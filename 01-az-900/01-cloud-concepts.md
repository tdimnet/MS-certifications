## Cloud Concepts


### The Language of Cloud Computing

- High Availibity means VMs can spin up fast to help process requests.
- Fault Tolerance describes how Azure will ensure you have zero downtime for
  services provided by Azure.
- Disaster Recovery uses times-to-recovery and recovery point metrics to
  recover from tornadoes, floods and more.
- Scalability refers to scalling out and scalling up
- Elasticity is the ability to quickly increase or decrease computer processing
  and ressources
- Agility means to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software
  applications.


### The Economy of Cloud Computing

- Capital Expendinture (CapEx) is buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a
  one time purchase
- Operational Expenditure (OpEx) is ongoing costs needed to run your business.
- Consumption-based pricing : let's you pay only for what you use.


### Cloud Service Models

- IaaS: provides servers, storage and networking as a service (Virtual
  Machine)
- PaaS: superset of IaaS and also includes middlware such as database
  managements tools (App Service, Azure SQL)
- SaaS: service built on top of PaaS (Office 365)
- FaaS/Serverless: you don't have any servers. It is a single function hosted,
  deployed, run and managed on its own.


### Azure Marketplace

- An extra layer of functionality for you cloud applications by letting users
  use and integrate third-party products and services.

### Cloud Architect Models

- Private Cloud: it is a cloud computing env in which all hardware and software
  resources are decidated exclusively to and accessible on by a single
  customer.
- Public cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure. No upfront costs but montly usage.
- Hybrid Cloud: a mix of private and public.
