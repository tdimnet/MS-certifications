# Deploying Your First Azure Virtual Machine

## About this Lab

In this hands-on lab, we will use the Azure Portal to create and use a virtual machine.

We will log in to the Azure Portal and create a virtual machine, a virtual network, and a network interface card for the virtual machine. Then, we will connect to the virtual machine via RDP. Finally, we will use the Azure Portal to turn the virtual machine off.

After completing this lab, you will have gained the experience required to create and use your first virtual machine using the Azure Portal.
